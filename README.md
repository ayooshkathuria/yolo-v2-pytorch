# yolo-v2-pytorch
A pytorch implementation of YOLO v2 object detection algorithm. 

This implementation is not expected to match results of the original YOLO algorithm (https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).
Instead, this is a personal project to get better at implementing large scale projects in PyTorch.
